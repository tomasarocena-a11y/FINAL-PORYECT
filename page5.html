			<p>The concept of hiring personal transportation dates back to the 17th century in cities like London and Paris, where people would use horse-drawn carriages known as "hackney carriages" for hire. The modern "taxicab" was truly born in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the invention of the taximeter and the introduction of motorized vehicles.</p>
